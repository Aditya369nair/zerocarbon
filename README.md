Carpooling App by students of ISGR, Gothenburg.

This is an attempt to create a simple carpooling app, as part of my PYP Exhibition project.

## Who we are
I am Aditya Nair, a student of ISGR Gothenburg Grade 5. We are a team of 4 kids


## Background
As part of our PYP final year project, we had been asked to pick up from some of the [UN Sustainability goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)
and collect information and create/provide solution towards that goal.
We chose to develop a carpooling app as that impacts following goals
* [climate action](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/) 
* [sustainable cities & communities](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cities/)

Carpooling also helps in reducing traffic related accidents and traffic jams in cities

## Functionality
The app provides a simple functionality for anybody to offer a ride by specifying source and destination location and number of seats available
This information is stored in Firestore and is available for anybody looking for a commute.


## Pending Functionality
* Login
* Fine granluarity of location
* specific day and recurring carpooling

## Demo
Here is a demo video of the app
